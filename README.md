# Pig-Game
A two player offline game created using HTML , CSS, JavaScript
In this game we have a dice and two players rolls dice one by one.
one player can roll a dice as much time as he want but on getting two six in row other player turn will come
each time whern a player roll a dice the value of dice is added to its score, he can continue rolling it or he can hold the score and give other player chance because if he gets two six in a row then he can loose all his score 
the one who reaches the score of 100 first wins the game and the other one looses it.
